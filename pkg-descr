BigCouch is a highly available, fault-tolerant, clustered, mostly api-compliant
version of Apache CouchDB. While it appears to the end-user as one CouchDB
instance, it is in fact one or more BigCouch nodes in an elastic cluster, acting
in concert to store and retrieve documents, index and serve views, and serve
CouchApps. BigCouch has been developed and is continually maintained by Cloudant
who offer hosted CouchDB as a service.

Clusters behave according to concepts outlined in Amazon's Dynamo paper, namely
that each BigCouch node can accept requests, data is placed on partitions based
on a consistent hashing algorithm, and quorum protocols are for read/write
operations.
